* How to use the resource definition:
*
* IMPLEMENTATION_INFO
*	{
*	implementation_uid  = <Your implementation UID here>;
*	version_no          = 1;
*	display_name        = "<Your plugin name here (just for debugging)>";
*	default_data        = "<One of the below UIDs your plugin will be part of>";
*	opaque_data         = "<Position of your plugin in the parent listbox>";
*	}
*
* For example plugins wishing to use Apps Plugin as a parent use 
* KGSAppsPluginUid (defined in GSFWViewUIDs.h):
*
*    default_data = "0x10207239";
*
* Note that position of the plugin is supported only for internally provided
* plugins. Others, such as 3rd party plugins, are sorted according to their
* name and plugin provider category.
*
* Plugin position must follow the postition defined in UI specification.
* Position starts from 0. Use -1 if position is not to be used in sorting.
